Suppose we want to write a function for square:

```{r}
x <- 10
xsq <- 10*10
```

Use the `function()` function to create a custom 
function. Put your working code between `{ }` on 
separate lines, put arguments between `()`, and give
your functin a name.
Use the `return()` function to return a value/object. 

```{r}
square <- function( x ) {
  return ( x*x )
}
```

It is always good to show some examples

```{r}
square( 10 )
```

How it works on a vector

```{r}
x <- 1:6
square(x) # (element by element)
```

How it works on a matrix

```{r}
m <- matrix(x, nrow=2)
m
square(m)
```
